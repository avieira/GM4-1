Dear Professor Evans,
I am most excited to tell you about the work of Carol Lin and her team. It is absolutly brilliant. I told you a bit about her work on how to transform old food into plastic in my last email, to let you know why I wanted to see her conference. Now I am even more impressed by her work.
The most incredible thing in her process is, with no doubt, the beggining : she needs food waste, like muffins or pastries. They then had the idea to use some fungi that will litteraly eat the food, in order to transform it into sugars and nitrogen compound. Afterwards, some bacteria are added to sugars, such that it can produce other chemicals like the succinic acid. At the end, they can use this acid (beside others, of course) to produce bioplastics, that can be used for detergent bottels, car parts and others. And the result is totally eco-friendly !
As soon as I return, I would like to talk with you on that subject in order to see if could make something with this.

Best regards,

Alexandre VIEIRA
